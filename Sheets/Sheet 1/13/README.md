You are designing a poster which prints out numbers with a unique style applied to each of them. The styling is based on the number of closed paths or holes presented in a given number.

The number of holes that each of the digits from 0 to 9 have are equal to the number of closed paths in the digit.

Their values are:

1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 = 0 holes.

0, 4, 6 and 9 = 1 hole.

8 = 2 holes.

Example: if number 3824 -> 3 has 0 holes, 8 has 2 holes, 4 has 1 hole and sum is 0 + 2 + 1 = 3.
